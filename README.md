# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

For this project, I created a table imbedded in a website that will dynamically search through a very large dataset to allow users to filter the data for specific values.  I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js for the webpage coding languages.


### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Created a basic HTML web page (index.html).

* I used a UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting based on the search criteria input by the user.

* Used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
